# Sass/SCSS Project

This project is part of the Holberton School web front-end curriculum.  
It focuses on mastering the **Sass (SCSS)** preprocessor through a series of tasks covering variables, nesting, mixins, loops, imports, and more.

## 📁 Project Structure

All the `.scss` files are located in the `sass_scss/` directory:

sass_scss/ ├── 0-debug_log.scss ├── 1-color_variable.scss ├── 2-color_variables.scss ├── 3-nested_tag.scss ├── 4-nested_class.scss ├── 5-nested_child.scss ├── 6-nested_hover.scss ├── 7-nested_deeper.scss ├── 8-mixin_margins.scss ├── 9-extend_list.scss ├── 10-colors.scss ├── 10-import_colors.scss ├── 11-loop_photos.scss └── 12-loop_header.scss

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- **Variables**: Store reusable values like colors and margins.
- **Nesting**: Write cleaner and more readable CSS rules.
- **Mixins**: Create reusable chunks of code with parameters.
- **@extend**: Share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.
- **@import / @use**: Modularize SCSS files (with `@use` replacing `@import`).
- **Loops**:
  - `@for` to iterate with numeric ranges.
  - `@each` to loop through a list of names.
- **Conditionals** (in advanced tasks).

## 🚀 How to Compile

To compile a single SCSS file into CSS:

```bash
sass file.scss file.css

⚠️ Note
Only .scss source files are pushed to the repository.
Generated .css and .css.map files are ignored.
